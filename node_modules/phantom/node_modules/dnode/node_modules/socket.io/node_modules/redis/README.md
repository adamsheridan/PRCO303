redis - a node.js redis client
===========================

This is a complete Redis client for node.js.  It supports all Redis commands, including many recently added commands like EVAL from
experimental Redis server branches.


Install with:

    npm install redis
    
Pieter Noordhuis has provided a binding to the official `hiredis` C library, which is non-blocking and fast.  To use `hiredis`, do:

    npm install hiredis redis

If `hiredis` is installed, `node_redis` will use it by default.  Otherwise, a pure JavaScript parser will be used.

If you use `hiredis`, be sure to rebuild it whenever you upgrade your version of node.  There are mysterious failures that can
happen between node and native code modules after a node upgrade.


## Usage

Simple example, included as `examples/simple.js`:

    var redis = require("redis"),
        client = redis.createClient();

    client.on("error", function (err) {
        console.log("Error " + err);
    });

    client.set("string key", "string val", redis.print);
    client.hset("hash key", "hashtest 1", "some value", redis.print);
    client.hset(["hash key", "hashtest 2", "some other value"], redis.print);
    client.hkeys("hash key", function (err, replies) {
        console.log(replies.length + " replies:");
        replies.forEach(function (reply, i) {
            console.log("    " + i + ": " + reply);
        });
        client.quit();
    });

This will display:

    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node example.js
    Reply: OK
    Reply: 0
    Reply: 0
    2 replies:
        0: hashtest 1
        1: hashtest 2
    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ 


## Performance

Here are typical results of `multi_bench.js` which is similar to `redis-benchmark` from the Redis distribution.
It uses 50 concurrent connections with no pipelining.

JavaScript parser:

    PING: 20000 ops 42283.30 ops/sec 0/5/1.182
    SET: 20000 ops 32948.93 ops/sec 1/7/1.515
    GET: 20000 ops 28694.40 ops/sec 0/9/1.740
    INCR: 20000 ops 39370.08 ops/sec 0/8/1.269
    LPUSH: 20000 ops 36429.87 ops/sec 0/8/1.370
    LRANGE (10 elements): 20000 ops 9891.20 ops/sec 1/9/5.048
    LRANGE (100 elements): 20000 ops 1384.56 ops/sec 10/91/36.072

hiredis parser:

    PING: 20000 ops 46189.38 ops/sec 1/4/1.082
    SET: 20000 ops 41237.11 ops/sec 0/6/1.210
    GET: 20000 ops 39682.54 ops/sec 1/7/1.257
    INCR: 20000 ops 40080.16 ops/sec 0/8/1.242
    LPUSH: 20000 ops 41152.26 ops/sec 0/3/1.212
    LRANGE (10 elements): 20000 ops 36563.07 ops/sec 1/8/1.363
    LRANGE (100 elements): 20000 ops 21834.06 ops/sec 0/9/2.287

The performance of `node_redis` improves dramatically with pipelining, which happens automatically in most normal programs.


### Sending Commands

Each Redis command is exposed as a function on the `client` object.
All functions take either take either an `args` Array plus optional `callback` Function or
a variable number of individual arguments followed by an optional callback.
Here is an example of passing an array of arguments and a callback:

    client.mset(["test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2"], function (err, res) {});

Here is that same call in the second style:

    client.mset("test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2", function (err, res) {});
    
Note that in either form the `callback` is optional:

    client.set("some key", "some val");
    client.set(["some other key", "some val"]);

For a list of Redis commands, see [Redis Command Reference](http://redis.io/commands)

The commands can be specified in uppercase or lowercase for convenience.  `client.get()` is the same as `client.GET()`.

Minimal parsing is done on the replies.  Commands that return a single line reply return JavaScript Strings, 
integer replies return JavaScript Numbers, "bulk" replies return node Buffers, and "multi bulk" replies return a 
JavaScript Array of node Buffers.  `HGETALL` returns an Object with Buffers keyed by the hash keys.

# API

## Connection Events

`client` will emit some events about the state of the connection to the Redis server.

### "ready"

`client` will emit `ready` a connection is established to the Redis server and the server reports 
that it is ready to receive commands.  Commands issued before the `ready` event are queued, 
then replayed just before this event is emitted.

### "connect"

`client` will emit `connect` at the same time as it emits `ready` unless `client.options.no_ready_check`
is set.  If this options is set, `connect` will be emitted when the stream is connected, and then
you are free to try to send commands.

### "error"

`client` will emit `error` when encountering an error connecting to the Redis server.

Note that "error" is a special event type in node.  If there are no listeners for an 
"error" event, node will exit.  This is usually what you want, but it can lead to some 
cryptic error messages like this:

    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node example.js 

    node.js:50
        throw e;
        ^
    Error: ECONNREFUSED, Connection refused
        at IOWatcher.callback (net:870:22)
        at node.js:607:9

Not very useful in diagnosing the problem, but if your program isn't ready to handle this,
it is probably the right thing to just exit.

`client` will also emit `error` if an exception is thrown inside of `node_redis` for whatever reason.
It would be nice to distinguish these two cases.

### "end"

`client` will emit `end` when an established Redis server connection has closed.

### "drain"

`client` will emit `drain` when the TCP connection to the Redis server has been buffering, but is now
writable.  This event can be used to stream commands in to Redis and adapt to backpressure.  Right now,
you need to check `client.command_queue.length` to decide when to reduce your send rate.  Then you can 
resume sending when you get `drain`.

### "idle"

`client` will emit `idle` when there are no outstanding commands that are awaiting a response.

## redis.createClient(port, host, options)

Create a new client connection.  `port` defaults to `6379` and `host` defaults
to `127.0.0.1`.  If you have `redis-server` running on the same compu
